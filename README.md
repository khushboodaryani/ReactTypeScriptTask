How to Run the Project

Prerequisites
	1.	Ensure Node.js is installed (v16+ recommended).
	2.	Install a package manager like npm or yarn.

Steps to Run:
	1.	Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/khushboodaryani/ReactTypeScript.git
cd form-app


	2.	Install dependencies:

npm install


	3.	Start the development server:

npm start


	4.	Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000.

Design Choices Made
	1.	Modern UI/UX: The app uses a clean and minimalistic design for better usability. The forms are styled for visual consistency and responsiveness.
	2.	Responsiveness: The layout adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring a seamless user experience across devices.
	3.	Component Reusability: Separate components were created for the signup and login forms to encourage code reusability and maintainability.
	4.	CSS Styling: CSS was used with a mobile-first approach, prioritizing simplicity and clarity.

Assumptions and Limitations

Assumptions:
	1.	Users will input valid data into the forms (e.g., email format).
	2.	This project is a frontend-only application, and no backend or database integration has been implemented.

Limitations:
	1.	No Validation Logic: Currently, the app does not include form validation. Adding it would enhance user experience.
	2.	No Backend Integration: The app does not handle actual signup or login requests. Backend support could be added in the future.
	3.	Basic Styles: Styling is functional but can be further enhanced with additional animations or themes.
